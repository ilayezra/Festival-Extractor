### I get an error saying I don't have ffmpeg, how can I install it?
You need to download ffmpeg and add it to path <br />
Please watch [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR36oH35Fgg) which best explains in depth how to install it properly.

### what's the difference between every file saving format?

- Mp3 <br />
  This is easily the most popular audio file format in the world. MP3 uses lossy compression algorithms to process audio. Though you lose much of the detail in the compression of the audio, MP3 sound produces a much smaller size than you’ll have in WAV or FLAC. This is why many players of different varieties rely on MP3 files to play music.

- Flac <br />
FLAC stands for ‘Free Lossless Audio Codec’ and is the most popular lossless format. Unlike uncompressed WAV audio, FLAC uses a lossless compression algorithm that retains all of the original audio without the size of a WAV file. If you want to store music in a lossless format, FLAC is best as it takes up way less space while still retaining the audio quality of a WAV.

- Wav <br />
  WAV is uncompressed, lossy audio that comes in a large file format retaining the original source audio. WAV is the universal file format for Windows, whereas AIFF is Apple’s version of WAV.

### what's the meaning of every extraction method?

- mono <br />
  This is the method to extract the stems as they were made, with 10 channels including all the parts (Drums, Bass, Lead, Vocals, Other) and spliting the parts into left and right hearing, this is how the songs are built in default.

- Stereo <br />
    When we talk about extracting the song into stems, the stereo method will be the best way to do so, just like the mono method, the stereo splits every part of the song (Drums, Bass, Lead, Vocals, Other) and he's combining them into a stereo channel, this is the best method to hear or to do anything with the stems as simple as possible.

- Single file <br />
  Just like it says, the single file method is taking all of the parts of the song and combine them into one audio file.
